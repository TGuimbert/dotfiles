# dotfiles

This is my personal dotfile repo to configure my NixOS workstations. It uses NixOS configuration and Home-Manager
as a NixOS module to configure almost everything. It has secure boot enabled through Lazanboot, disk encryption
with LUKS and opt-in storage persistence between boot with Impermance.

I try to keep it as simple as possible by having most of the configuration common to all workstation.
